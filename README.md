## This repo contains a .config file for a bootable working Linux kernel configuration with most hardware working for a Lenovo Thinkpad X230 running Gentoo Linux. The files cpuinfo.txt and lspci-output.txt contain what their names imply, with latter also giving more insight into what hardware is yet to work.
